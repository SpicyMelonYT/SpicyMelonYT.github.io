        "A few videos of a Wendigo character I designed and animated. I wanted to make something in the horror genre and a Wendigo is a great creature to use for that as it is part of the human animal beast collection along with the 'Wearwolf', 'Minotaur', 'Harpie', 'Satyr', and 'Centaur'.<br><br>The horror I am most interested in is techically phycologial horror. However the meaning of that is not as detailed as it can be. There are so many thoughts that flare up in your mind as you experience something scary or threatening. And while each one is very complex, they all follow a similar pattern that horror movies have been trying to capitalize on for years. And while I am NOT saying that I did so in these animations, I had that in mind while making them. Especially in the street scene ;)",
