- ✅ **CORS-Free**: Embedded directly to avoid local development issues
- ✅ **Text Selectable PDFs**: Generated PDFs maintain full text accessibility

### Resume Sections Included:

3. **Page 3**: Education, professional links

### PDF Generation:
- Click the download button to generate a professional PDF
- Automatic page breaks between sections
- Print-optimized styling with proper margins
- Fully text-selectable and searchable

### Future Updates:
